# Binary-Search-Problems
Problem 1: Find the First Occurrence
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the first occurrence of a given element. If the element is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

Problem 2: Find the Last Occurrence
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the last occurrence of a given element. If the element is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

Problem 3: Count Occurrences
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to count the number of times a given element appears in the array.

Problem 4: Find the Minimum Element
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the minimum element in the array.

Problem 5: Find the Maximum Element
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the maximum element in the array.

Problem 6: Check for Duplicates
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to check if there are any duplicates in the array. If duplicates are found, return true; otherwise, return false.

Problem 7: Search in a Matrix
Description:
Given a 2D array (matrix) of integers, write a function to search for a given element in the matrix. If the element is found, return its position as a pair of indices; otherwise, return {-1, -1}.

Problem 8: Find Element Greater Than X
Description:
Given an array of integers and a value X, write a function to find the first element in the array that is greater than X. If such an element is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

Problem 9: Find the Kth Occurrence
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find the index of the Kth occurrence of a given element. If the element is found at least K times, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

Problem 10: Find All Indices
Description:
Given an array of integers, write a function to find all indices of a given element. Return the indices as a list. If the element is not found, return an empty list.
